# Data-Science-Capstone-Project
Project files for my Data Science Capstone course done in Spring 2023 at UW-Platteville

## Project Description
As part of the Data Science Capstone course in Spring 2023, I, along with 2 other senior capstone students, worked with Southwestern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission (SWWRP) to try and predict failure within SW Wisconsin counties. Using data provided by the Wisconsin Department of Revenue and additional data on ARPA funds provided by our data sponsors we were tasked with creating a repeatable report for SWWRP.

## Process
During the project we established multiple metrics to define failure within SW Wisconsin municipalities through constant feedback with the data sponsors. Our original metric of taking total expenses versus revenue was too sensitive to small amounts. We then established that a fund would usually be held by municipalities in case of an emergency. This fund is estimated by taking 25% of the previous year's expenses. Our new metric was then seeing if the total revenue minus total expenses exceeded this fund. These moments oif exceeding were called "vulnerability". After doing so we took deeper looks into each municipality and to what might be casuing these vulnerabilities. These breakout reports would look at all sources of operating revenue and expenses to see the self-sustainability of municipalities. These vulnerabilities were also compared to the SW Wisconsin region as well as the rest of the Wisconsin state municipalities to determine if these vulnerabilities were the cause of the municipalities poor status or if the whole region was effected.

## Machine Learning
Early attempts at machine learning algorithms were unsuccessful at predicting these vulnerabilities due to the lack of additional data. Additionally, due to the short time span of data we obtained (2013-2021), small changes in the data could cause large effects when predicting too far into the future. As such, we were unsuccessful as of the semester end at prediciting vulnerabilities, and more time and data would be needed to see any true effects.

## Conclusions
The project as a whole was good to see the process of data science through cleaning data and exploration, to constant feedback of our sponsors. The project as a whole was a good exposure into a real world scenario and into a busniess aspect.
